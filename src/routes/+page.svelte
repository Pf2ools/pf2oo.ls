				This website is a work in progress. What it once aims to do is be an all-encompassing wiki for all things to do with the Pathfinder 2e ruleset. Much akin to <a class="anchor" target="_blank" href="https://2e.aonprd.com/">Archives of Nethys</a>. But newer, more modern. <span class="text-xs text-white/15">Maybe even a character sheet one day.</span>

			<h1 class="font-sans h4 text-center">Ok but how do I host this?</h1>
			<hr class="hr border-primary-300-700 shadow-primary-contrast-300-700">
			<p>
				The website can be hosted either by means of serving static html files on the web, or as a Node server. The latter will (eventually) allow for maintaining a database of your own, so your content doesn't disappear if you happen to clear your browser storage, as well as share your content with other people in a centralized manner.

				If you are eager to see this project being continued, feel free to throw a <a class="anchor" target="_blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/mrvauxs">ko-fi</a> to its creator! Otherwise, word of mouth is a great substitute.

			<p>
				If you are interested in contributing, there's two pathways. One is contributing typo fixes and new content to the <a class="anchor" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Pf2ools/pf2ools-data">pf2ools-data</a> repository. The other, is to contribute directly to the codebase of the website you are reading this on, <a class="anchor" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Pf2ools/pf2oo.ls">pf2ools</a>.
			</p>
			<p>For the latter, basic knowledge of <a class="anchor" target="_blank" href="https://svelte.dev/docs">Svelte and SvelteKit</a> is encouraged, as well as <a class="anchor" target="_blank" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html">Typescript</a>.</p> The repository also uses the <a class="anchor" target="_blank" href="https://bun.com/">Bun runtime</a> for package management and script running. So make sure that's installed.
